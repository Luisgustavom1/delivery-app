From Elastic Search, we have the kibana tool, which is a data visualization and management tool. This makes it increasingly easy to analyze and make decisions based on data, which has been searched, grouped and enriched in the way we want by Elastic Search.

#### Use case
This was one, of the many possible dashboards created for this app. In it we can see QUICKLY and CLEARLY, the total amount of runs performed, the amount of browsers connected at the current moment, a visualization on the map of each position where the delivery car passed and some graphs for more detailed visualization.
